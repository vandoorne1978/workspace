Problem:

1.	I need a script to build a directory structure in my repository.
2.	The script needs to take an ASCII tree as input.
3.	The tree will be defined in a .md file.

Proposed Solution:

1.	Ask AI for a script to create a directory structure.
2.	As input, copy/paste a tree structure into the AI interface that represents my directory structure.

Expected Results:

1.	The AI generates a script that produces the directory structure.

Results:

1.	AI returned a bunch of stuff I didn't need.  Considerations.

Next Steps:

1.	Refine question.
